Ensure you have MacOS, Homebrew, and perhaps some other things I forgot to mention.

1. *Copy* all files to the user directory, e.g. `/Users/quinnouyang`. **Do not clone the repository directly there.**
2. Review `Brewfile` and comment/uncomment as needed, likely avoiding already-installed software. Then execute `brew bundle install`.
3. Manually do a bunch of crap. Good luck lol:)
